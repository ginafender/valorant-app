valorant app ideas:

how many kills were stolen from you in your game?

have different rankings based on how much damage you did - how hard was the kill stolen from you

distance vs kills accuracy?

how many kills you got while crouching


data analysis ideas high elo vs low elo:
rounds won with util (lineups?)
rounds won by kills/spike 
defender kills outside of spawn vs defender kills on site
top most used guns
most common plant locations and how often they were defused
around what time on the clock is spike planted



list where you get most of your kills on each map (location, on site vs off site, are you an aggressive player, etc)


OFFICIAL IDEAS:
kills based on positioning (x, y), to show if you play too aggro, push too much, etc
	-what direction both people were facing during the fight (if you were shot in the back, etc)
how often you were flashed
how much damage you did, vs other people (did you kill get 'stolen')?
most common death spots
